## Talk outline

- Course info
	- Overview: audience, content, description
	- Structure: 
		- Skills: data wrangling, EDA, visualization, basic inference, modeling, effective communication of results
		- Computation: R + RStudio + git/GitHub
		- Case studies: movie reviews, sports, airline delays, paris paintings, ...
		- Assessment: in class team exercises, individual HW, midterm + final project, take home final exam
- Computation:
	- R/RStudio: server
	- R Markdown: why and how
		- Why: 
			- Noble goal: Only workflow is a reproducible workflow
			- Teaching goal: 
				- Seeing code and output in one place helps learning
				- Syntax highlighting
			- Efficiency goal: Easier grading!
		- How: Knit early and often
	- git/GitHub via RStudio: why and how
		- Why: Early introducton + marketibility
		- How:
			- As course management system
			- For team collaboration
			- Details on org/repo
		- Challenges:
			- Remember to pull before starting work 
			- Resolving merge conflicts
			- Sometimes RStudio interface isn't sufficient
			- First assignment an individual assignment (not team)
- Exercise examples:
	- modeling paris paintings
	- basketball data scraping + shiny
- Interest and impact:
	- data on student interest for course
	- curricular changes inspired by course
		- gender balance comment
